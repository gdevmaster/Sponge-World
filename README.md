Instructions:
This is a .bps patch, not a rom file.
To play this, follow these steps.

You must first acquire an unmodified SMW Rom file.
For legal reasons, you must figure this step
out yourself.

Next, you must patch the file using SMW Central's bps patching tool,
though any bps patching tool should work. Use your unmodified SMW Rom
as the base, and the bps patch as the patch. Tool: https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=onlinetools&tool=flips

Next, obtain a Super Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator. (SNES)
Personally, I use snes9x. I would download snes9x straight from github because
their official website seems to have sketchy pop-up ads.

Once all of those steps are completed, you will be able to play
this Rom Hack.
